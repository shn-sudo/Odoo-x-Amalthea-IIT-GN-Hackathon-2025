# Hackathon Approach & Project Vision

*Submitted for Odoo x Amalthea, IIT GN Hackathon 2025*

## About This Project

This project is an expense management system developed during the Odoo x Amalthea Hackathon. It demonstrates my approach to problem-solving, technical skills, and ability to learn and build under time constraints. While I am new to Python and backend development (my background is primarily C++), I utilized AI assistance to accelerate my learning and focus on building a functional core system.

*Note: This project was developed with the help of AI tools to accelerate learning and development during the hackathon. The goal is to demonstrate logical thinking, technical skills, and a commitment to clean, well-structured code while learning independently.*

## Core Requirements Addressed

*   **User Management:** Role-based system (Admin, Manager, Employee) with secure signup and login (JWT).
*   **Expense Lifecycle:** Submit, view (own/subordinates'), approve/reject.
*   **Multi-Step Approval Workflow:** Defined rules for sequential approvals (basic logic implemented, rules management planned).
*   **Currency Conversion:** Convert submitted expenses to the company's base currency.
*   **Receipt Processing:** OCR for extracting data from receipts (planned feature).
*   **Real-time Data:** Uses external APIs for country/currency and exchange rates.

## My Focus & Expectations for Review

As this is my first hackathon, I aimed to focus on:

*   **Logical Thinking:** Designing a clear workflow for expense submission and approval.
*   **Technical Skills:** Learning Flask, SQLAlchemy, JWT, and implementing the core features correctly.
*   **Clean Code:** Writing readable, well-structured, and commented code (e.g., fixing `foreign_keys` issues, modular design).
*   **Scalability & Modularity:** Designing the backend (API and database) to be potentially scalable and modular (e.g., separate models, utility functions).
*   **Problem-Solving:** Addressing challenges like the `AmbiguousForeignKeysError` and building the approval logic step-by-step.
*   **Development Approach:** Using Git for version control and documenting the process.

I hope the reviewers appreciate the effort to learn new technologies quickly and build a functional foundation, even if the frontend or more complex features are not fully polished due to time constraints.
