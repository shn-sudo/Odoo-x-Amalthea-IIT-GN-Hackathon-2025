## **Expense Management System - Hackathon Project**

> **A scalable, clean, and modular solution for automating company expense reimbursement processes.**

**Note:** This project is being developed as part of a hackathon. While AI assistance is being used as a guide and brainstorming partner, the core goal is to learn, build, and understand the concepts independently. Every effort will be made to research, code, and debug using personal understanding and external resources, with AI input primarily used for structuring ideas and overcoming specific hurdles.

### **Project Vision**

To build a robust, user-friendly, and scalable expense management system that eliminates the pain points of manual reimbursement processes. The system will provide transparency, enforce configurable approval workflows, and offer features like OCR for receipts, real-time currency conversion, and detailed audit trails — all while being built from scratch with minimal external dependencies.

### **Core Problem Statement**

Companies struggle with manual, error-prone, and opaque expense reimbursement processes. My solution aims to:
- Automate and streamline the submission and approval workflow.
- Provide flexible, rule-based multi-level approvals.
- Ensure data integrity and security through robust design.
- Offer a clean, intuitive UI for all user roles (Admin, Manager, Employee).

---

### **Key Features & User Roles**

#### **1. Authentication & User Management (Admin)**
- On first signup, an Admin user and a Company record are auto-created.
- The Company’s base currency is set based on the selected country.
- Admin can:
  - Create and manage Employees & Managers.
  - Assign and change user roles.
  - Define manager-employee relationships.
  - Configure complex approval rules.

#### **2. Expense Submission (Employee)**
- Submit expense claims with:
  - Amount (in any currency).
  - Category, Description, Date.
  - Option to upload/scan a receipt (OCR integration).
- View personal expense history (Approved, Rejected, Pending).

#### **3. Approval Workflow (Manager/Admin)**
- Expenses follow a defined sequence of approvers.
- Example Sequence: `Manager → Finance → Director`.
- Each approver receives a request only after the previous one acts.
- Managers can:
  - View pending approvals.
  - Approve/Reject with comments.
  - See amounts converted to the company’s base currency in real-time.

#### **4. Conditional Approval Rules (Admin)**
- **Percentage Rule**: e.g., "60% of approvers must approve."
- **Specific Approver Rule**: e.g., "If CFO approves, auto-approve."
- **Hybrid Rule**: Combine both (e.g., "60% OR CFO approves").
- Rules can be combined with sequential flows for maximum flexibility.

### **Technical Requirements & Design Philosophy**

This project prioritizes **scalability**, **clean code**, and **robust architecture** over speed of development. We aim to impress reviewers with our technical depth and attention to detail.

#### **Database Design (Critical!)**
- Use **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL** (local setup preferred).
- Avoid BaaS platforms (Firebase, Supabase, MongoDB Atlas).
- Design normalized, relational tables for Users, Companies, Expenses, Approvals, and Rules.
- Ensure referential integrity and efficient indexing.

#### **Backend API**
- Build a RESTful API from scratch (Node.js/Express, Python/Flask, or similar).
- Implement proper input validation and graceful error handling.
- Use environment variables for sensitive data (API keys, DB credentials).

#### **Frontend UI**
- Clean, responsive, and intuitive design.
- Intuitive navigation for all user roles.
- Interactive elements (e.g., dynamic dropdowns, status indicators).
- Mockups available: [Excalidraw Link](https://link.excalidraw.com/l/65VNwvy7c4X/4WSLZDTrhkA)

#### **Currency Conversion & OCR**
- Use `https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all?fields=name,currencies` for country/currency data.
- Use `https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/{BASE_CURRENCY}` for real-time conversion.
- Implement basic OCR (Tesseract.js or similar) for receipt scanning.

#### **Error Handling & Validation**
- Validate all user inputs (email, password, amounts, dates).
- Provide clear, user-friendly error messages.
- Log errors for debugging purposes.

#### **Version Control & Collaboration**
- Use **Git** for version control.
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages.
- Branching strategy: `main`, `develop`, feature branches.

### **Evaluation Criteria (What the Judges Care About)**

| Category             | What to Focus On                                                                 |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Coding Standard**  | Consistent style, meaningful variable names, proper indentation.                  |
| **Logic**            | Clear, efficient algorithms; handle edge cases.                                    |
| **Modularity**       | Break code into reusable, independent modules (e.g., auth, expense, approval).     |
| **Frontend Design**  | Clean, responsive UI; intuitive navigation; accessibility.                         |
| **Performance**      | Optimize queries, minimize API calls, use caching where appropriate.               |
| **Scalability**      | Design for future growth (e.g., multiple companies, thousands of users).           |
| **Security**         | Secure authentication, protect sensitive data, sanitize inputs.                    |
| **Usability**        | Easy for non-technical users; clear feedback; helpful tooltips.                    |
| **Debugging Skills** | Include logging, error handling, and unit tests where possible.                    |
| **Database Design**  | **MOST IMPORTANT!** Well-structured schema, relationships, normalization.          |

### **Development Approach**

1.  **Start Small, Think Big**: Begin with core functionality (signup, login, submit expense), then add complexity (approval rules, OCR).
2.  **Modular Architecture**: Separate concerns (frontend, backend, database, services).
3.  **Test as You Go**: Write unit tests for critical functions (validation, currency conversion).
4.  **Document Everything**: Comment your code, update README.md regularly.
5.  **Collaborate & Innovate**: If working in a team, divide tasks wisely. If solo, focus on depth over breadth.
6.  **Enjoy the Process**: Hackathons are about learning, creativity, and having fun!

---

### **Tools & Technologies (Suggested)**

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express / Python + Flask
- **Frontend**: React / Vue.js / Svelte (or plain HTML/CSS/JS if time-constrained)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (preferred) or MySQL
- **OCR**: Tesseract.js (JavaScript) or pytesseract (Python)
- **Currency API**: `exchangerate-api.com`
- **Country Data**: `restcountries.com`
- **UI Mockup**: Excalidraw (already provided)
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub

---

### **Final Notes**

- **Avoid Copy-Paste**: Understand every line of code you write. Know *why* you’re using a library or pattern.
- **Real-Time Data**: Use websockets or polling for live updates (e.g., approval status).
- **AI/Blockchain**: Only include if they genuinely add value (e.g., AI for receipt categorization).
- **Prototype First**: Use static JSON for initial UI mockups, but replace with real DB calls before final submission.

### ** To End **
You’ve got this. Remember, the goal isn’t to build the most complex system, but to build a **well-thought-out, clean, and functional** one that demonstrates your **logical thinking, technical skills, and passion for solving real-world problems**.
